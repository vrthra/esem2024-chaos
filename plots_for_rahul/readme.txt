These are so called 'forest plots'. Usually they use not percents but numbers for x scale.
Normalization is done against the ground truth number of killable mutants. With that it is easier to compare subjects. The ground truth (assessment goes against it) is always 1 (the black line).  The gray line to the right is the total number of mutants normalized. The line(s) to the left are killed number of mutants normalized. The blue bars around 1 are CI for the ground truth. The right part of charts is clipped, since it doesn't really matter how much the estimation overestimates when it's larger than the total number of mutants.

In ./3 and ./4 we have not the forest plot. solid line at 1 is the total number of mutants.
